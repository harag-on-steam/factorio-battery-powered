[entity-description]
bp-battery-charger=Charges any kind of batteries, with a small chance of battery failure. Charged batteries can be used in vehicles, locomotives, and battery-powered generators.
bp-battery-discharger=Releases any kind of charged battery power if no primary generators are available, with the same priority as an accumulator.
bp-holmium-battery-charger=Charges any kind of batteries, with a small chance of battery failure. Charged batteries can be used in vehicles, locomotives, and battery-powered generators.
bp-holmium-battery-discharger=Releases any kind of charged battery power if no primary generators are available, with the same priority as an accumulator.

battery-powered-burnt-inventory-size=Number of vehicle output slots

[mod-setting-description]
battery-powered-dischargers=Should battery-powered generators be available or not? Disable this if you want to use batteries as fuel but not as a transportable form of energy.
battery-powered-decay=Recharging batteries will degrade them. Up to 2% will be lost in the process. Better batteries degrade progressively less. Disabling this will make batteries zero-maintenance besides recharging them.
battery-powered-delivery-cannon=Adds recipes to shoot discharged batteries via delivery-cannon. Charged batteries are deemed too dangerous to be transported that way.
battery-powered-k2-fuel-rebalance=Rebalances batteries to Krastorio2's acceleration and speed settings. Will do nothing if the corresponding K2 setting is disabled.
#battery-powered-jetpack-fuel=
battery-powered-burnt-inventory-size=Stack sizes are balanced so that three vehicle fuel slots of charged batteries stack into one stack of discharged batteries.\n\nIn case another mod changes the number of fuel slots or the stack size of discharged batteries this setting allows to give enough output slots for that.
battery-powered-equipment-fuel=Supports Krastorio 2 and Portable Power Equipment
