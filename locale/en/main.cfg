[entity-description]
bp-battery-charger=Charges any kind of batteries, with a small chance of battery failure. Charged batteries can be used in vehicles, locomotives, and battery-powered generators.
bp-battery-discharger=Releases any kind of charged battery power if no primary generators are available, with the same priority as an accumulator.
bp-holmium-battery-charger=Charges any kind of batteries, with a small chance of battery failure. Charged batteries can be used in vehicles, locomotives, and battery-powered generators.
bp-holmium-battery-discharger=Releases any kind of charged battery power if no primary generators are available, with the same priority as an accumulator.

[mod-setting-description]
battery-powered-dischargers=Should battery-powered generators be available or not? Disable this if you want to use batteries as fuel but not as a transportable form of energy.
battery-powered-decay=Recharging batteries will degrade them. Up to 2% will be lost in the process. Better batteries degrade progressively less. Disabling this will make batteries zero-maintenance besides recharging them.
